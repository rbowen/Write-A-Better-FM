Mostly what you need to know is:

perl Makefile.PL && make pdf

You'll also need to have a LaTeX toolchain installed.

At this point we'll assume that you know how to install LaTeX, and 
that if you don't you're probably not going to be working on this
project. As it gets more mature, this will become a more useful
resource.
